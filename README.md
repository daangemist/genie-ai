=================

A module to easily use stt and tts in a project. Features stt triggering via a wake word.

This module currently is an empty shell. I will work on it in the coming weeks. The stt part
will mostly be a wrapper around the [sonus](https://github.com/evancohen/sonus) project. Text-to-speech
should be available online (Google, Amazon Polly, etc.) and offline (espeak, mimic, etc.).
